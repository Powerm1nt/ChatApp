# Test Results for Chat App Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unknown User and Empty Message Issue
**Problem**: Messages were showing "Unknown User" and empty content
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between backend `ChatMessage` interface and frontend expectations
**Fix**: 
- Updated `ChatMessage` interface to use `content` instead of `message`
- Added proper `author` object with `id` and `username`
- Updated message broadcasting in both socket and REST API

### 2. Members Panel Not Listing Users Correctly  
**Problem**: UserListPanel wasn't receiving proper user data structure
**Root Cause**: `SocketUser` interface missing `status` and `role` fields expected by frontend
**Fix**:
- Added `status` and `role` fields to `SocketUser` interface
- Updated `addSocketUser` method to set default values
- Added `get-room-users` socket event handler

### 3. ChannelList Badly Refreshed When Events Occurred
**Problem**: Channel list not updating properly on channel operations
**Root Cause**: Socket events were working but there might be timing issues
**Fix**:
- Improved socket event handling consistency
- Fixed room ID construction in UserListPanel

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
1. **chat.gateway.ts**:
   - Updated `ChatMessage` interface structure
   - Fixed message broadcasting to use correct field names
   - Added `get-room-users` socket event handler
   - Fixed typing event to use proper user ID

2. **chat.service.ts**:
   - Added `status` and `role` fields to `SocketUser` interface
   - Updated `addSocketUser` to set default values

3. **chat.controller.ts**:
   - Fixed message broadcasting in REST API to use correct structure

### Frontend Changes:
1. **socketStore.ts**:
   - Updated `ChatMessage` interface to match backend
   - Fixed system message creation

2. **MessagePanel.tsx**:

   - Fixed room ID construction for guild channels

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Message Display**:
   - Send a message in any channel
   - Verify author name appears correctly (no "Unknown User")
   - Verify message content appears correctly (no empty messages)

2. **Test Members Panel**:
   - Join a guild channel
   - Check if members list shows users correctly
   - Verify user status indicators work

3. **Test Channel Operations**:
   - Create a new channel
   - Verify channel list updates immediately
   - Edit/delete channels and verify updates

## Expected Results

- ✅ Messages should display proper author names
- ✅ Message content should appear correctly  
- ✅ Members panel should list users with status
- ✅ Channel list should refresh properly on events
- ✅ No more "Unknown User" or empty messages
