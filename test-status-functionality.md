# Profile Status Feature Test

## Overview
This document outlines the testing of the newly implemented profile status feature that allows users to control their status (online, do not disturb, inactive, offline) through the ProfileControl menu.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **Updated UserStatusIndicator.tsx**:
   - Changed status types from `"online" | "away" | "busy" | "offline"` to `"online" | "do not disturb" | "inactive" | "offline"`
   - Updated color mappings and labels to match new status types

2. **Enhanced ProfileControl.tsx**:
   - Added status selection submenu in the dropdown
   - Integrated with auth store for status updates
   - Added visual indicators for current status
   - Implemented status change handling with error management

3. **Updated authStore.ts**:
   - Added `status` field to User interface
   - Implemented `updateUserStatus` function
   - Added API integration for status updates

### Backend Changes
1. **Updated User Entity**:
   - Added `status` field with proper typing and default value

2. **Enhanced AuthController**:
   - Added PATCH `/api/auth/status` endpoint
   - Added validation for status updates

3. **Updated AuthService**:
   - Implemented `updateUserStatus` method
   - Added proper error handling and validation

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Access the Application
- Navigate to http://localhost:5173
- Sign in or create an account

### 2. Test Status Selection
1. Look for the ProfileControl component (usually at the bottom left)
2. Click on your profile area to open the dropdown menu
3. Look for "Set Status" option with a colored circle indicator
4. Click on "Set Status" to see the submenu with all status options:
   - Online (green)
   - Do Not Disturb (red)
   - Inactive (yellow)
   - Offline (gray)

### 3. Verify Status Changes
1. Select different status options
2. Verify that:
   - The status indicator color changes immediately
   - The status label updates in the profile display
   - The current status shows a checkmark in the submenu
   - The status persists after page refresh

### 4. Test API Integration
1. Open browser developer tools (Network tab)
2. Change your status
3. Verify that a PATCH request is made to `/api/auth/status`
4. Check that the request succeeds (200 status code)

## Expected Behavior

### Visual Indicators
- **Online**: Green circle
- **Do Not Disturb**: Red circle
- **Inactive**: Yellow circle
- **Offline**: Gray circle

### Status Persistence
- Status should persist across browser sessions
- Status should be reflected in all UI components that show user status
- Status changes should be immediate with optimistic updates

### Error Handling
- If API call fails, status should revert to previous state
- Error messages should be logged to console
- UI should remain responsive during status updates

## API Endpoints

### Update Status
```
PATCH /api/auth/status
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "online" | "do not disturb" | "inactive" | "offline"
}
```

### Get User Profile (includes status)
```
GET /api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Database Schema
The User entity now includes:
```typescript
@Property({ default: 'online' })
status: 'online' | 'do not disturb' | 'inactive' | 'offline' = 'online';
```

## Notes
- Status defaults to "online" for new users
- Anonymous users can also set their status
- Status is included in all user profile responses
- The feature is fully integrated with the existing authentication system
