# Socket Connection and Channel Events Test

## Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx - Socket Initialization on Authentication
- Added socket initialization when user is authenticated
- Socket connects automatically when user logs in
- Socket disconnects when user logs out
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

### 2. ChannelList.tsx - Explicit Channel Fetching
- Added useEffect to fetch channels when component mounts
- Fetches channels when guildId changes
- Uses the guild store's fetchChannels method

### 3. Socket Events Flow
```
User Authentication → Socket Initialization → Event Subscription
                                          ↓
Channel CRUD Operations → Backend Broadcasts → Frontend Receives Events → Store Updates
```

## Backend Socket Events (Already Implemented)
- `channel-created`: Broadcasted when a channel is created
- `channel-updated`: Broadcasted when a channel is updated  
- `channel-deleted`: Broadcasted when a channel is deleted

## Frontend Socket Event Handlers (Already Implemented)
- Listens for channel events and updates guild store
- Automatically refreshes channel list when events are received
- Handles current room cleanup when channel is deleted

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Access frontend**: http://localhost:5173

3. **Login anonymously** and check browser console for:
   - "User authenticated, initializing socket connection..."
   - "Connected to server"

4. **Navigate to a guild** and check console for:
   - "Fetching channels for guild: [guildId]"

5. **Create/Update/Delete channels** and verify:
   - Real-time updates in channel list
   - Console logs showing received events

## Expected Behavior

✅ Socket connects when user authenticates
✅ Channel list updates in real-time
✅ Socket events properly subscribed
✅ Store hooks update app data contents
✅ No more channelList issues

## Key Implementation Details

- Socket initialization moved to App.tsx for global scope
- Uses proper React hooks (useEffect) for lifecycle management
- Leverages existing store architecture (socketStore + guildStore)
- Maintains separation of concerns between socket and guild management
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
