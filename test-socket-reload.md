# Socket Connection Reload Test

## Issue Description
When user changes status, socket connection works and chat loads. But on app reload, chat never comes up - socket connection has issues at initialization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Socket Initialization (`socketStore.ts`)
- **Added `autoConnect: true`** to socket.io configuration for more reliable connection
- **Set socket immediately** in store so components can access it before connection completes
- **Added auto-reconnect logic** for unexpected disconnections with 2-second delay
- **Added retry logic** for connection errors with 3-second delay
- **Improved disconnect handling** to distinguish between manual and unexpected disconnects

### 2. Fixed Auth Store Subscription
- **Added state comparison** to prevent unnecessary socket re-initialization during app startup
- **Added 100ms delay** to ensure auth is fully established before socket initialization
- **Better logging** to track when socket initialization is triggered

### 3. Enhanced MessagePanel Component
- **Improved socket readiness check** - wait for socket to exist first, then check connection
- **Added detailed logging** for room joining and message restoration
- **Better error handling** for socket operations

## Key Improvements

### Socket Store Changes
```typescript
// Before: Socket set after all event handlers
set({ socket: newSocket });

// After: Socket set immediately so components can access it
set({ socket: newSocket });
newSocket.on("connect", () => {
  // Connection handling
});
```

### Auth Subscription Changes
```typescript
// Before: Initialize on any user state
if (state.user) {
  initializeSocket();
}

// After: Only initialize when user state actually changes
if (state.user && !prevState?.user) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    initializeSocket();
  }, 100);
}
```

### MessagePanel Changes
```typescript
// Before: Strict requirement for isConnected
if (!socket || !isConnected || !user) return;

// After: Wait for socket first, then connection
if (!socket || !user) return;
if (!isConnected) {
  console.log("‚è≥ Waiting for socket connection");
  return;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Test normal flow**:
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Sign in (anonymous or with account)
   - Navigate to a guild/channel
   - Verify chat loads and messages appear

3. **Test reload scenario**:
   - While in a chat channel, reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Check browser console for socket connection logs
   - Verify chat loads properly after reload
   - Send a message to confirm socket is working

4. **Test status change scenario**:
   - Change user status (if implemented)
   - Verify socket connection remains stable
   - Verify chat continues to work

## Expected Behavior

### Console Logs to Look For
- `üîå User authenticated, initializing socket connection`
- `‚úÖ Socket connected to server successfully`
- `üè† Joining room: { roomId, guildId, username }`
- `üì® Restored X messages for room: roomId`

### Error Scenarios Handled
- Connection failures with automatic retry
- Unexpected disconnections with auto-reconnect
- Race conditions during app initialization
- Socket availability before components try to use it

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for socket connection errors
2. Verify backend is running and accessible
3. Check network connectivity
4. Look for CORS issues in browser dev tools
5. Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
