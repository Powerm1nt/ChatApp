# Channel List Refresh Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Data Synchronization in Guild Store
- Modified `fetchChannels()` to update both the `channels` array and the `guild.channels` property
- Modified `fetchGuilds()` to extract channels from guilds and populate the `channels` array
- This ensures that when socket events trigger `fetchChannels()`, the ChannelList component gets updated data

### 2. Updated Dialog Components
- Changed `CreateChannelDialog` to use `useGuildStore` instead of `useSocketStore`
- Changed `EditChannelDialog` to use `useGuildStore` instead of `useSocketStore`
- This ensures consistent data management through a single store

## Test Steps

1. **Open two browser tabs** to the same guild
2. **Create a channel** in tab 1
   - Expected: Channel appears in both tabs without manual refresh
3. **Edit a channel** in tab 1
   - Expected: Channel name updates in both tabs without manual refresh
4. **Delete a channel** in tab 1
   - Expected: Channel disappears from both tabs without manual refresh

## Technical Details

The issue was that the ChannelList component was accessing `currentGuild?.channels` but the socket events were only updating the separate `channels` array in the store. The fix ensures both data structures stay synchronized.

### Before:
- Socket events → `fetchChannels()` → updates `channels` array only
- ChannelList → reads from `guild.channels` → stale data

### After:
- Socket events → `fetchChannels()` → updates both `channels` array AND `guild.channels`
- ChannelList → reads from `guild.channels` → fresh data
